# Neo-Doro

**Neo-Doro** is a modern task management application that reimagines the classic **Pomodoro Technique** with a dynamic and customizable focus system. Designed to enhance productivity, Neo-Doro helps users manage their time effectively by dividing work into structured **projects** and **tasks**. Each task is powered by a **dual-timer system**, optimizing focus periods and strategic rest intervals to maintain long-term productivity without burnout.

## Key Features

### ⚙️ Dual Timer System
Neo-Doro offers two types of timers—**Focus Time** and **Rest Time**—helping users seamlessly switch between work and rest periods to maintain balance.

### ⏲️ Customizable Focus Duration
Users can define their own **focus periods**, such as 4 hours, allowing flexibility depending on the nature of their tasks.

### 🛌 Adaptive Rest Periods
Rest periods are calculated based on a **percentage** of the focus period. For example:
- If the focus time is **4 hours** and the rest percentage is **20%**, the rest period will be **48 minutes** (4 hours × 0.2).

### 🔄 Incremental Focus Timer
Unlike traditional countdown timers, Neo-Doro’s **Focus Timer** operates like a stopwatch, **counting upwards** from zero. This allows users to focus on time invested rather than how much time remains.

### ⏳ Countdown Rest Timer
The **Rest Timer** switches to countdown mode during breaks, letting users know exactly how much time is left before returning to work.

### 🚦 Maximum Rest Threshold
Rest periods are capped at **30%** of the total focus time to ensure a balanced workflow. For example, if the focus session is 4 hours, the maximum rest period would be 72 minutes.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Project**: Users can create multiple projects, each containing related tasks.
2. **Start a Task**: Set a **focus duration** (e.g., 4 hours) for each task.
3. **Work with Focus**: The **incremental timer** starts counting upwards, motivating users to stay engaged.
4. **Take a Break**: Switch to the **Rest Timer**, which counts down based on the set rest period.
5. **Maintain Balance**: Ensure the rest duration does not exceed **30%** of the focus period.
